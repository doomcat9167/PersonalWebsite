                              <img src="assets/img/hack3.png" class="img-thumbnail img-rounded" alt="">
                              Team Virus had a different approach towards creating a game at the
                              Hackathon.  Create a modern board game that our generation would enjoy. Traditional board games now have been replaced by console games and online games. It is more likely that board games are only played on holidays or special occasions.

                              It was clear that traditional board games tend to take a long time as it lasts an hour or more. So our inital approach was to create a fast-paced strategy board game with shorter set-up and only lasts an hour at max.

                              Once our protoype of the board game was created, we were constantly testing it, and adding new elements to the game that would raise the variability of the game and changes the objectives through out the game. Our final version of the game hasa mixed elements of Monopoly, Stratego, Risk and Settles of Caton.

                              <img src="assets/img/webApp.png" class="img-thumbnail img-rounded" alt="">
                              In addition to the physical board, the team had made a web application could select chance cards and roll desired amount of dices. The web application uses javascript to roll dices and select cards with specific probability, based on the card.

                              One of the biggest lesson I've learned at the event was being on schedule. Many fierce competitors had awesome ideas for their games but didn't anticipated the difficulty of their project resulting in incomplete project. Our team was able to finish our final product very quickly, and was able to test the game with other competitors and visitors.  This allowed us to easily see improvements and errors the game had. I remain to believe that not only getting the project done, but continuing to furnish the game was a big part of making the board game succesful.

                Team Virus had a different approach towards creating a game at the QuackHack. Make a fast-paced board game that everyone would enjoy playing. With the rise of modern console gaming, traditional board games are now only played on special occasion such as holidays.
                <br><br>
                One of the problem that we had clearly identified in many traditional board games is that they simply take too long to play, normally lasting up to an hour. Our team had concluded that we wanted to create a fast-paced board game that would combine elements of other traditional board games including Monopoly, Stratego, Risk and Settles of Caton.
                <br><br>
                While the physical board was constructed by the product design team, the coding team had created a web application for the board game. The web application uses javascript to roll different number of dices and select cards with specific probability based on the card. These card images were created using GIMP.

                Being able to complete our project early allowed us to test it numerous times with the visitors at the QuackHack. I believe this was one of our main success. Even though we had thought our final product was complete, there was always room for improvements when the creators of the board game weren’t playing it. This resulted in polishing the game over and over again to create the best desired board game to our team’s satisfaction.

                        <p>In spring term each year, the CIS Department at the University of Oregon holds the Annual Julif's Programming Competition. The purpose of the competition is the encourage interest in programming among CIS majors, potential majors, and other students interested in problem solving and programming.

                          My partner and I solved three problems, barely beating fourth-place team by 30 seconds. While the problems were very challenging to us, solving problems with a partner in a short amount of time developed my communication and time-management skills.
